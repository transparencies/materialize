## What's new!

- [Replacement materialized views](/releases/#replacement-materialized-views).
  Modify the definition of an existing materialized view while preserving all
  downstream dependencies.

- **Performance improvements**. Up to 2.5x [increased
  QPS](/releases/#v26.9-qps) and significant [reduction in query
  latency](/releases/#v26.9-latency-reduction). See [Release
  Notes](/releases/#improvements-2).

- [ConfigMap for system parameters](/releases/#v26.9-sm-configmap). You can now
  use a ConfigMap to dynamically update system parameters for Self-Managed
  deployments.

For more information on these and other changes, see the [Release Notes](/releases/).
