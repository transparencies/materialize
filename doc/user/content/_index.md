  Apache Iceberg tables.

- [Replacement materialized views](/releases/#replacement-materialized-views).
  Modify the definition of an existing materialized view while preserving all
  downstream dependencies.

- [ConfigMap for system parameters](/releases/#v26.9-sm-configmap). You can now
  use a ConfigMap to dynamically update system parameters for Self-Managed
  deployments.
