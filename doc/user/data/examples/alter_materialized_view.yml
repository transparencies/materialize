        The name of a replacement materialized view specifically created for

    Assume that `winning_bids_replacement` is hydrated to avoid downtime and
    that `winning_bids` is not behind `winning_bids_replacement` (see
    [Recommended checks before replacing a
    view](/sql/alter-materialized-view/#recommended-checks-before-replacing-a-view)
    for details).

    The following example replaces the `winning_bids` materialized view
    with `winning_bids_replacement`:
  code: |
    ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW winning_bids
    APPLY REPLACEMENT winning_bids_replacement;
  testable: false  # TODO: Need to add test_setup for the example.

    When replacing a materialized view, the operation:

    - Replaces the materialized view's definition with that of the replacement
      view and drops the replacement view at the same time.

    - Emits a diff representing the changes between the old and new output.

- name: "prereq-recommendations-short"
  content: |
    Before applying the replacement materialized view:
    - Verify that the replacement materialized view is hydrated to replace without downtime.
    - Verify that the original materializedview is up to date with its
    replacement.

- name: "prereq-recommendations"
  content: |

   Before applying the replacement view:

   - Verify that the replacement view is hydrated to avoid downtime:

     ```mzsql
     SELECT
        mv.name,
        h.hydrated
     FROM mz_catalog.mz_materialized_views AS mv
     JOIN mz_internal.mz_hydration_statuses AS h ON (mv.id = h.object_id)
     WHERE mv.name = '<replacement_view>';
     ```

    - Verify that the original view is up to date with its replacement.

      ```mzsql
      SELECT o.name, f.write_frontier
      FROM mz_objects o, mz_cluster_replica_frontiers f
      WHERE o.name in ('<view>', '<view_replacement>')
      AND f.object_id = o.id;
      ```

      To successfully replace a materialized view, the original and the
      replacement materialized views need to both be up to date. If the original
      is lagging behind the replacement, the command waits for the original view
      to catch up. During this wait, the replacement view buffers any changes it
      receives from its inputs, which could cause the cluster to run out of
      memory. If the  command does not execute successfully, we recommend
      canceling to prevent out-of-memory errors. To avoid this situation, t is
      recommended to first check whether the original materialized view is up to
      date with the replacement.

      {{< tip >}}
      If the original view is behind, you can rerun the query to check the
      progress of the original materialized view. If the rate of advancement
      suggests that catch up will need an extended period of time, it is
      recommended to drop the replacement view.
      {{< /tip >}}

    - Verify that the downstream objects (i.e., the cluster(s) hosting the
    downstream objects) are able to process the diffs emitted by the operation.
    Depending on the size of the changes, this may cause temporary CPU and
    memory spikes
