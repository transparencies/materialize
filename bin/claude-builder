# Runs Claude Code using bin/ci-builder, limiting its actions to inside a
# Docker container which has access to the current working directory. Persists
# ~/{.claude/,.claude.json}. Skips all Claude Code permissions checks, but
# doesn't hand any secrets into the Docker container. Main limitation: Can't
# run further Docker containers, so no mzcompose available! Forwarding the
# docker socket would be a security risk.
